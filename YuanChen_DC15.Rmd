##  Data Computing Chapter 15
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dygraphs)
library(ggplot2)
library(mosaicData)
```

# Question 15.1
```{r}
ggplot(CPS85, aes(x = sex, y = wage, group = sex))+ 
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = sex, fill = sex), alpha = 0.75, outlier.colour = "black") +
   xlab("sex") + 
  ylab( "wage")
```

# Question 15.3
```{r}
ggplot(CPS85,mapping = aes(x = educ,y = wage, color = sex)) +
   stat_smooth(method = lm) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5,
             size = 2)  +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, size = 2)

```


# Question 15.5
1.Yes, the fracton is going from up to down, so we can say high elderly populations tend to have high child populations. 

2.The regression line is not parallel to the x-axis, we can't say that the data is consistent with the fact that there is no relationship between elderly population and child population.
